# CostSystemSim
This repository contains computer code that simulates cost systems. This repository accompanies the paper:

Anand, V., Balakrishnan, R., and E. Labro. A Framework for Conducting Numerical Experiments on Cost System Design. Forthcoming in *Journal of Management Accounting Research*.

Subscribers to the *Journal of Management Accounting Research* can access the pre-print manuscript [here](http://aaajournals.org/doi/abs/10.2308/jmar-52057). The paper is also publicly available on [SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2994065).

We provide our code, written in C#, as a Visual Studio Solution. For instructions on how to modify and run the code, see the [appendix](https://vicanand.weebly.com/uploads/6/9/6/9/69692683/designing_costing_experiments_appendix.pdf) to the paper.
